# REST API Principles (Delete until complete it)

This README outlines the key principles of our REST API and provides examples for clarity.

## 1. URLs for Everything

- Each resource (data or functionality) should have a unique URL, similar to a web address.

    Example: `/users/1` to retrieve user with ID 1.

## 2. HTTP Verbs

- Use standard HTTP verbs for CRUD operations:
    - GET for reading,
    - POST for creating,
    - PUT for updating, and
    - DELETE for deleting.

    Example: 
    - `GET /users` to retrieve all users.
    - `POST /users` to create a new user.

## 3. JSON in the Body

- Typically, use JSON in request and response bodies to send and receive data. JSON is easy to understand and work with.

    Example Request:
    ```json
    POST /users
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    ```

## 4. Hierarchical Structure

- Organize your URLs hierarchically to reflect the structure of your data.

    Example: `/departments/HR/employees` to get HR department employees.

## 5. Stateless

- REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request should carry all necessary information. No server-side state should be maintained between requests.

## 6. Informative Responses

- Include HTTP status codes in responses to indicate success or issues. For instance, use `200 OK` for success and `404 Not Found` for resource not found.

    Example Response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "User not found",
      "status": 404
    }
    ```

## 7. Versioning

- Consider versioning your API in the URL or headers to ensure future compatibility.

    Example: `/v1/users` for version 1 of the users endpoint.

## 8. Security

- Implement security measures such as authentication and authorization to protect your resources.

## 9. Documentation

- Provide clear and detailed documentation on how to use your API, including request and response examples.

    Example:
    - Check our API documentation [here](https://example.com/api-docs).

## 10. Testing and Monitoring

- Conduct comprehensive testing and establish monitoring systems to ensure API performance and availability.
